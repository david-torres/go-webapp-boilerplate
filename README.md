# Go Web Application Quickstart

The goal of this project is to provide a simple skeleton project for a web application using a Go backend. Routing and other web application niceities are provided by [Echo](https://echo.labstack.com/) web framework. The basic idea here is that you're going to be serving static html/js/css/image assets and the backend is primarily treated as an api.
